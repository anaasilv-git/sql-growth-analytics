# SQL Growth Analytics

This repository is dedicated to studying, simulating, and practicing SQL applied to **CRM, growth, customer behavior, and data-driven decision-making**.

Here, I organize real and structured SQL queries that support analyses such as:
- identifying and engaging active customers  
- building and measuring conversion funnels  
- cohort analysis and longitudinal customer behavior  
- churn, frequency, and value metrics  
- essential KPIs for CRM and Growth strategies  

This project reflects my approach as a data-driven economist:  
**understanding patterns, optimizing resources, predicting behavior, and transforming information into action.**

## 🧠 Project Vision

This repository is built on three pillars:

### **1. Economics applied to CRM**  
Elasticity, incentives, and behavioral patterns are not just theory — they are the backbone of retention and growth.

### **2. Growth with methodology**  
Growth is not random testing. It is experimentation, diagnosis, and continuous improvement.

### **3. Data with purpose**  
SQL is only valuable when it creates clarity, alignment, and actionable insights.

## 💬 Why this project exists

Because data analysis is not about “knowing SQL” —  
it’s about **asking better questions**.

This repository is my personal lab to:
- practice  
- learn  
- evolve  
- and build real technical depth in CRM and digital product analytics.

Feel free to explore, adapt, or suggest improvements!  
📫 More examples, datasets, and exercises coming soon.
